## System requirements

We used R 4.0.2 programming language (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) to conduct 
most steps of the data analysis. To reproduce our work, a set of hardware 
requirements may be needed. We used a single machine with 16 logical processors 
for the 2.10 GHz central processing unit (CPU) (Xeon® E5-2620 v4, Intel®, Santa 
Clara, CA, USA), 128 GB RAM, and 11 GB graphics processing unit (GPU) memory 
(GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Parallelism was applied 
for CPU computing. However, we set the codes to be able for running only 
non-expensive and shorter computation. This only requires 6 GB RAM and 1 CPU.


## Installation guide

Please follow through the R Markdown (pest.Rmd) or R Script (pest.R). 
Installation approximately requires ~5 minutes.


## Demo

All codes require ~20 minutes to complete for non-expensive and shorter 
computation. We provided pre-existing files to substitute the expensive and 
longer computation. One can set a variable that defines whether the expensive 
and longer parts will be conducted. All complete computation may take weeks to 
complete.


## Instructions for use

Briefly, all system requirements, installation guide, demo, and instructions 
for use are available in R Markdown (pest.Rmd) and R Script (pest.R), and 
other files in this repository.

The R Markdown (.Rmd) contains the programming codes for the data analysis. The 
codes for core steps in the analysis pipeline are also provided exclusively in 
an R Script (.R). The codes beyond the core steps were used for analytic 
decision or creating tables or figures. These are shown to provide details on 
how data are processed to construct all tables and figures in the main text.
